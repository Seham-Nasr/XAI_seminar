# XAI_seminar
This repository contains Tutorial notebooks for "Explainable AI for Affective Speech Recognition".

# Setup
### Virtual Environment (optional)
Setup a new conda environment and install all the required libraries

`conda create --name your-env-name`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Datasets
For simplicity, we perform experiments on one dataset. 
Ravdess: contains 1440 audio recordings from 24 individuals.

2- Download link: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)

Extract the dataset into the newly created folder named `data`.
The final path of the dataset should look like 'XAI_seminar/data/Ravdess/audio_speech_actors_01-24/'

If the dataset is downloaded and extracted in a different directory, please ensure the paths defined in _notebooks_ match their location and names.

The proceed data and extracted features are available in CSV file formats _'XAI_seminar/emoRav_data.csv'_, and _'XAI_seminar/speech_features.csv'_ respectively. Therefore you can skip the notebook called _data_processing.ipynb_.

# Network architecture and trained models
The Sequential CNN trained model on Ravdess data is available in the directory _'/XAI_seminar/trained_model/Speech_CNN.h5'_.

# Usage
I recommend beginning with the notebook titled _'data_processing.ipynb'_ to familiarize yourself with the dataset. This notebook offers a straightforward implementation for processing and visualizing Ravdess speech data.

For the next step, you have two options:

1- Train the Model from Scratch: Start by training the model using the provided dataset. After training, test the model with the available metrics and save it for the subsequent step of post-hoc explanation.

2- Use a Pre-Trained Model: Alternatively, you can use the pre-trained model available at _'/XAI_seminar/trained_model/Speech_CNN.h5'_ to skip the training phase.

**Final Step: Generating SHAP Explanations**

To generate SHAP explanations, follow the instructions in the notebook _'/XAI_seminar/trained_model/SHAP_XAI4SER.ipynb'_. Please note that generating SHAP values for all 1440 instances in the dataset can be computationally intensive. For learning purposes, consider sampling a smaller subset of instances and proceed with feature importance generation as demonstrated in section C13 of the notebook.
